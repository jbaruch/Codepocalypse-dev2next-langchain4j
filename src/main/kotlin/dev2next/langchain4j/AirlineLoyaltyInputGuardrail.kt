Airline loyalty program topics include:
- Elite status (Medallion, Premier, Diamond, Platinum, Gold, Silver, etc.)
- Earning and redeeming miles/points
- Status qualification requirements (MQMs, MQDs, PQPs, PQFs, etc.)
- Tier benefits and perks
- Upgrades and priority services
- Specific airlines (Delta, United, American, Southwest, etc.)
- Partnerships and co-branded credit cards
- Travel-related questions about loyalty programs
- Comparing loyalty programs

- "YES" if the question is about airline loyalty programs
- "NO" if the question is about anything else

Do not provide explanations. Only answer YES or NO."""
